# Contributing to AppUpdatesHelper

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Discussing the current state of the code

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as to accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/bq/AppUpdatesHelper/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/bq/AppUpdatesHelper/issues/new)!

## Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Make sure your code lints and passes the Checkstyle rules.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License 2.0](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. 
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can in order to reproduce the issue
  - Add the stack traces you find in case the library makes your app crash
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We provide a [code-style](code-style.xml) and [checkstyle](checkstyle.xml) configuration files so you can ensure that all code is properly formatted according to our guidelines.
Please be sure to use these files to format your files when submitting pull requests.
